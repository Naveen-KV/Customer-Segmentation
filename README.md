# Customer-Segmentation

### AIM
Aim of this project is to segment customers into different clusters based on their credit card usage.

### DATASET
DataSet used is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata)

### DATA PRE-PROCESSING
Almost all features had outliers. Since deleting those records will result in loss of data, arranged the values into ranges and performed modelling.

### ML MODEL
Used K-Means ML Algorithm for clustering
